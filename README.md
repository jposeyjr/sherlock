# Sherlock

## Description

Sherlock is a program in development that will be used to help those with vision impairments to be able to view and access the web quickly and easily. Sherlock is not limited to websites that are only designed with accessibility in mind but any website. It will fetch all html/css files using those to render only relevant information or add accessibility features such as describing an image without alt tags, informing the user of buttons not “typed” as buttons, etc.

Currently it is only designed with getting basic crawling functions working and fleshing out the design pattern that will be used. It is also set up to try different types of crawling and has a lot of passing around of code to test proper async/await function timing needed for the future.
